Active Record Extensions.

=== Validations 
== validates_constraints
This uses the information one can extract from ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapter::Column 
to add default validations. The text?, limit and type methods are used to guess what validations are to be added
validates_constraints make some assumptions (see below) and none of its behaviour is configurable.
(you can always use the standard validations in addition to make some adjustments)

 * Adds validates_presence_of for columns with not null constraints (unless type is :boolean)
   * options are added so that empty strings will pass, unlike if you add the validate_presence_of yourself.
     If you want to have different behaviour then just add a validation yourself
 * Adds validates_inclusion_of(:in => [true, false]) for columns with not null constraints and :boolean type
 * Adds validates_length_of for text columns with not null limit

portnumbers and any subdomains. Instead of a domain name, you can use ip address too (version 4).

use ip address too (version 4).
